# Relativistic spaceflight simulator

Special thanks to Mr.doob for three.js (WebGL wrapper and scene graph renderer) and Silvio Paganini for help with adapting my bloom effect to three.js

This is a relativistic spaceflight simulator which shows what it would look like if you were on a 
spaceship traveling close to the speed of light. 
It is loosely based on my original code from 2012 implementing relativistic effects in my game The Polynomial.

The code is currently a bit of a mess and needs a cleanup.
